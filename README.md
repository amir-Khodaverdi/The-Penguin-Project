# The-Penguin-Project
Please make changes only in **new branches**, not the main branch.
**main branch** is the final version of the project and will be changed right before the deadline of each phase.
Try to use proper commit descriptions for your changes.   

**DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO PROGRAM SOURCE CODE**
